# Asanas-yoga-website
Using the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, I had created a Yoga website named ASANAS through which the user can book yoga classes with best instructors. 
The website provides with :
* Company name
* Navigation bar 
* Direct contact buttons
* Booking card

<br> :star: What new thing I learnt in this project? </br> 

<br>I learnt about the "Glassmorphism" which is applied in the booking card. Using the styling concepts like background, box-shadow, backdrop-filter (used to apply graphical effects like blur, color shift), webkit (web browser engine used by some browsers, it is used for animation, transition effects).
> Webkit-backdrop-filter helped to apply the blur effect to the element via webkit.
